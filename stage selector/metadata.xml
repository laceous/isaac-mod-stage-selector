    <description>This mod integrates with Mod Config Menu to provide a stage selector for normal and greed mode. You can choose from all stages on the normal path as well as the pre-ascent and ascent. You can also choose between normal first stages and XL stages. There's no way to force XL ascent stages. The game will simply use whatever you had for that floor earlier in your run.

Forcing XL happens via a callback so it's possible for other mods to break this functionality. Picking up Black Candle will disable XL floors.

There's options to:
[list]
    [*]Restart the game
    [*]Kick off a victory lap
    [*]Reseed the current stage
[/list]

You can use this mod to test or practice certain parts of the game.

You can tweak the following stats to help you play catchup if you skip to later parts of the game:
[list]
    [*]Speed
    [*]Tears
    [*]Damage
    [*]Range
    [*]Shot Speed
    [*]Luck
[/list]

There's options to give yourself:
[list]
    [*]The Polaroid: allows access to the Chest and the ascent
    [*]The Negative: allows access to the Dark Room and the ascent
    [*]Key Pieces 1 and 2: allows access to Mega Satan
    [*]Knife Piece 1: causes the mines escape sequence to spawn
    [*]Knife Piece 2: together with Knife Piece 1 allows access to the Mausoleum Heart and the Corpse
    [*]0 - The Fool: card that teleports you to the starting room
    [*]VIII - Justice: card that drops random heart/key/bomb/coin
    [*]Rune of Ansuz: rune that gives full mapping for the current floor
    [*]Cracked Key: single-use Red Key (creates red rooms)
[/list]

You can also toggle the following debug option:
[list]
    [*]Infinite HP: taking damage won't hurt you (debug 3)
[/list]

There's 4 challenges included that you can use as a playground. All of them end after the first stage so you need to use the menu to go to the next stage if that's what you want to do. You'll start as Isaac with the D6.
[list]
    [*]Stage Selector (Normal)
    [*]Stage Selector (Hard)
    [*]Stage Selector (Greed)
    [*]Stage Selector (Greedier)
[/list]

This mod is enabled for other challenges too, but can likely break them.</description>
